 * here comes the code style,

 *
 Documentation Rules:

 For variables:
 int var; Detailed description after the member

 For functions one can use the @ param command to document the parameters and then use [in], [out], [in,out] to document the direction. For inline documentation this is also possible by starting with the direction attribute, e.g.

 * @ brief description
 * @ param v
 * @ return None

 void foo(int v << [in] docs for input parameter v. );
